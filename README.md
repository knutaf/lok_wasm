# LOK-Wasm

This is a web-based implementation of the puzzle game [LOK](https://letibus.itch.io/lok). It has a puzzle editor and a checker. The interface takes a lot of care not to give the player information about how the rules work. It's best to play through the original game properly in the intended order. This could be used to help check solutions or confirm understanding. Well, I've implemented my understanding of the rules; it's possible I missed some nuance.

This was created using the [Rust wasm-pack tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/tutorials/npm-browser-packages/index.html), so see instructions there for how to build and run it.
